Music Technology Activity Games (M-TAG), is a portable contactless system that allows paediatric patients to rehabilitate their upper limbs through fun and engaging music games, in a non-immersive virtual reality environment; Made possible using the latest hand tracking device, the Leap Motion Controller. 

With this controller, the patient‚Äôs fine hand movements are captured while they play the games. These games help patients to stay motivated while they rehabilitate their upper limbs through the specifically designed exercises that the game offers. By just plugging the controller into any laptop, patients can start their rehabilitation sessions anywhere and anytime. 

Especially during extraordinary times, which is COVID-19, M-TAG allows rehabilitation for the patients to be conducted at home, while enabling therapists to remotely track their progress and improvements using cloud services such as Huawei Cloud and GovTech‚Äôs DECADA, during and post-Covid.

M-TAG was built on research showing gamified rehabilitation's beneficial effects on paediatric upper limb rehabilitation. Taking inspiration from classic arcade games, this system uses music, gamification and data analysis to help patients stay motivated and engaged.

M-TAG is split into 2 sections: Patient-oriented games and Therapist-oriented games. 

Under the Patient-oriented games, patients get to play songs within a game crafted for upper limb rehabilitation exercises. Moreover, they can choose their exercises, hand use, song choice and game speed to suit their motor abilities. The games are Speedy Car and Fighter Plane. 

  - Speedy Car targets a patient‚Äôs lateral and medial rotation of their shoulder as well as the pronation and supination of their wrist respectively. It enables them to play a song by collecting music coins and avoiding obstacles with a car controlled by their upper limb movements. For every music coin collected, a note of the song will be played; this continues until the patient completes the song or reaches the finish line. 

  - Fighter Plane targets the patient‚Äôs flexion and extension of their elbow and shoulder respectively by using their upper limbs to virtually navigate through an asteroid-filled space in a fighter plane. Additionally, the patient can grasp their hands to play a part of a song when they encounter a wall obstacle.

Both patient-oriented games are able to extract patient motion data such as maximum rotation angle and lateral velocity from the Leap Motion device and save it to a local CSV file and DECADA cloud. Moreover, a bespoke application, Intelligent Bot System (IBS) will be able to seek patient records and show their progress analysis.

Under the Therapist-oriented games, the Sound Machine game acts as a tool for the therapist to help their patients express themselves through music. This section was made with research on Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE) that helps patients improve their motor control through sound patterns.

  - Within Sound Machine, there are 2 sub-games: Audio Manipulator and Drum Machine. Audio Manipulator manipulates sounds (pitch/volume) based on the patient‚Äôs hand pitch and rotation, while Drum Machine acts as a virtual snare drum for patients to use during therapy.

**Note**: Patients are not required to be musically proficient to play the games, but rather enjoy the process of rehabilitating through learning and playing music.
